# httpcache 1.2.0

* Update tests to use latest features and function naming from `httptest`

# httpcache 1.1.0

* Remove `cachedDownload`. Use `GET(url, config=write_disk(destfile))` instead, which caches normally.

# httpcache 1.0.2

* Minor adjustment to a validation function's error message format to adapt to changes in R's development version.

# httpcache 1.0.0

New cached request functions:

* `cachedPOST()` to cache results of a POST request for resources where a POST gets content and does not alter server state.
* `cachedDownload` to cache the result of `download.file`.

Functions to access the cache API:

* `hitCache()` to check for the existence of a cache entry
* `getCache()` to read it
* `setCache()` to set a cache value
* `buildCacheKey()` to construct a cache key that incorporates the request's query parameters and body.

Tools to save and restore cached queries across R sessions:

* `saveCache()`
* `loadCache()`

Logging improvements:

* Add content-length and all curl request timings (not just "total") to log messages.
* Trim trailing whitespace in log messages
* Fix `loadLogfile()` for when reading a log with only CACHE messages

# httpcache 0.1.8

* Include milliseconds in timestamps

# httpcache 0.1.6

* Improve error message for when a non-character input is given to `GET()`

# httpcache 0.1.4

* Ensure that caching is on by default
* Change `GET()` not to check cache if an uncached request is made. Previously, `uncached()` checked cache but did not write to the cache.
* Fix regular expression matching in popQuery
* Improve escaping of characters in URLs for dropping cache by pattern
* Add vignette

# httpcache 0.1.2

* Revise and resubmit to CRAN

# httpcache 0.1.0

* Extract code and tests from the [crunch](https://crunch.io/r/crunch/) package
* Document and export functions for caching, invalidating, and logging
